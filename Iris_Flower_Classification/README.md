# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their sepal and petal characteristics. The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which is often used as a beginner's dataset in machine learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)
- Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arijit258/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
```

### Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook `iris_flower_classification.ipynb` to view the step-by-step process of loading the dataset, exploring the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.


This script will load the preprocessed data, train the machine learning model, and display the accuracy of the model on the test set.

## Dataset

The dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

## Model

We use a simple machine learning model, such as a Logistic Regression, to classify iris flowers based on their features. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set.

## Results

The accuracy of the model on the test set is displayed in the output. Additionally, the `results` folder contains visualizations of the model's predictions compared to the actual labels.
